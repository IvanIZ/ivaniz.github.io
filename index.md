I am a master's student researching at the Autonomous System Lab at the University of Waterloo, advised by Prof. Stephen L. Smith. I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in 2022. During my undergraduate study, I had the pleasure of working with Prof. Katherine Driggs-Campbell in hierarchical human intention tracking for human-robot collaborations. After graduating from UIUC, I was honored to work with Prof. Kris Hauser as a post-baccalaureate research assistant on attentiveness estimation for mobile robot teleoperation. 

My research interests are in artificial intelligence and robotics, in particular in the context of planning and control for mobile robot obstacle avoidance.
