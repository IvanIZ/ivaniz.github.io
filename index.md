I am a first-year PhD student in Robotics at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I received the MASc degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Waterloo in 2025, where I was advised by [Prof. Stephen L. Smith](https://uwaterloo.ca/autonomous-systems-lab/profiles/stephen-smith) on learning-based planning. I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in 2022. During my undergraduate study, I collaborated with [Prof. Katherine Driggs-Campbell](https://krdc.web.illinois.edu/) in human-robot collaborations. After graduating from UIUC, I worked with [Prof. Kris Hauser](https://kkhauser.web.illinois.edu/) on mobile robot teleoperation. 

My research interests are in robotics and robot learning, particularly in the context of planning, control, and human-robot interactions.
