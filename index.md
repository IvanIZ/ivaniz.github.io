I am a master's student researching at the [Autonomous System Lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/autonomous-systems-lab/) at the University of Waterloo, advised by [Prof. Stephen L. Smith](https://uwaterloo.ca/autonomous-systems-lab/profiles/stephen-smith). I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in 2022. During my undergraduate study, I had the pleasure of working with [Prof. Katherine Driggs-Campbell](https://krdc.web.illinois.edu/) in hierarchical human intention tracking for human-robot collaborations. After graduating from UIUC, I was honored to work with [Prof. Kris Hauser](https://kkhauser.web.illinois.edu/) as a post-baccalaureate research assistant on attentiveness estimation for mobile robot teleoperation. 

My research interests are in artificial intelligence and robotics, particularly in the context of planning and control for mobile robot obstacle avoidance.
