## Context-Aware Multi-Channel Human-Pet-Robot Interactions
<img style="float: right; padding-left:20px;" src="/assets/hardware_figure.jpg" width="200" height="100">

Pet ownership is becoming increasingly popular. However, owning a pet could be both time and financially demanding, preventing potential pet owners from obtaining their desired pet counterparts. Nonetheless, robotic pets have recently emerged as an alternative. The foundation of a rewarding pet experience is rooted in human-pet interactions and the pets' capability of perceiving the context of interactions. In this work, a context-aware human-pet-robot interaction system is developed. In particular, multi-modal sensor data, including audio and vision, are used to extract multi-channel context cues, such as the owner's posture, gesture, and audio keywords. A rule-based model is proposed to fuse the detected context signals and estimate the appropriate interaction context, such as engagement or following, and the pet robot behaves accordingly. The context detection model is evaluated in a sequence of human-robot interactions and promising evaluation results are reported.
